# newsSum

A Google App Engine application to parse RSS feeds and HTML pages to extract headlines.  Result is available via JSON.

~~Memcache is used to reduce process time.~~ There is no memcache service for GCP Python 3 runtime and the Memorystore for Redis isn't free, so no caching is done on the server side. For now, use the `cache-control` header to have browser / proxy to do the caching.

UI is implemented with jQuery and Bootstrap.

A sample instance is hosted at https://news-sum.appspot.com/

Feel free to fork and add more sources (refer to the `sources` folder). Classes under the `sources` folder that extend the `BaseSource` class will be automatically discovered by the `get_sources` function and added to the list.
